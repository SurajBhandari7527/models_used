When he leans in for a closer look, the spider senses him and delivers a bite, injecting its powerful venom into his bloodstream. This venom triggers a rapid transformation as Peter's DNA begins to merge with that of the spider, enhancing his strength, agility, and reflexes in ways he could never imagine. Suddenly, he feels an incredible surge of power, his senses heightened, and as he instinctively catches a falling exhibit, he realizes his life is forever changed. With great power comes great responsibility, and Peter is about to embark on an extraordinary journey as a superhero, all thanks to that fateful bite. "  # Your text input
